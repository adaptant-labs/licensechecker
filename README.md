A reimplementation of http://www.boyter.org/2017/05/identify-software-licenses-python-vector-space-search-ngram-keywords/ using Go while I attempt to nut out the nuances of the language. Will this turn into a full blown SPDX parser of some description in the future? That depends on how sucessful I am writing Go and how much I enjoy it :)

Would be nice to have the following output styles,

	formatted IE CLI viewable
	JSON
	CSV

command line options include, deep guess, confidence, path, database file
